If you listen to music while painting, I also have a super sophisticated 3D headphone enhancement app on Steam: http://store.steampowered.com/app/444970/

1. Install AutoHotKey: http://ahkscript.org/
I use the 64bit version on my SP4.

2. Now ArtDock.ahk should have a blue file icon with a red H on it. Double-click it to start the app.

3. The app will only respond to touch, and become invisible if you try to reach it with your pen.

4. To exit the app, touch the X in the top right corner. If the touch GUI crashes or hangs, you can right-click the green AutoHotKey icon in your systray and choose Exit there.

5. You can add support for other apps by copying and modifying one of the files in the txt folder. Afterwards, you need to add a button for your new app to the main menu, which is stored in MenuDock.txt 

If you add support for another app, please send a pull request on GitHub:
